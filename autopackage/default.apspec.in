[Description]
Sh looks like a portable C++ library for computer graphics, and can be 
used that way. However, it supports a special retained mode, which 
collects a sequence of Sh operations into a program (at run time), 
optimizes it and generates code for modern GPUs. This lets you write 
programs for graphics cards in C++ itself, rather than a separate 
language such as Cg or the OpenGL Shading Language. Using Sh is very 
natural and offers many advantages, and it presents many new features 
not found in other shading languages.

[BuildPrepare]
# If you're using autotools, the default should be enough.
# prepareBuild will set up apbuild and run configure for you. If you
# need to pass arguments to configure, just add them to prepareBuild:
# prepareBuild --enable-foo --disable-bar
prepareBuild --without-sdl

[BuildUnprepare]
# If you're using prepareBuild above, there is no need to change this!
unprepareBuild

[Imports]
# This command will tell makeinstaller what to include in the package.
# The selection comes from the files created by 'make install' or equivalent.
# Usually, you can leave this at the default
echo '*' | import

[Install]
# See http://www.autopackage.org/api/ for details
installLib lib/*.so.*
copyFiles lib/sh/*.so* $PREFIX/lib/sh
copyFiles include/sh/*.h* $PREFIX/include/sh
copyFiles include/shutil/*.h* $PREFIX/include/shutil

[Uninstall]
# Leaving this at the default is safe unless you use custom commands in
# "Install" to create files. By default, all autopackage API functions are
# logged.
