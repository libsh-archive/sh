- remove OpenGL dependence
  -change drawQuad to use ShVertexArray 
  -remove glClear
- handle vec ops with different element types
  (e.g. multiply vectors with ShAttrib1f and ShColor3f elements) 
- clean up sharing render temporaries 
  (framebuf, 2D textures, ubufs)
  Currently, all ShlaVectors using the same sized render temporaries
  are subclasses of ShRenderable with static instances of all
  the required temporaries.
- sparse matrices
- scalar multiplication
