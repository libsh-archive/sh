- remove OpenGL dependence
  -change drawQuad to use ShVertexArray 
  -remove glClear
- handle vec ops with different element types
  (e.g. multiply vectors with ShAttrib1f and ShColor3f elements) 
+ clean up sharing render temporaries 
  (framebuf, 2D textures, ubufs)
- sparse matrices
- scalar multiplication
- delayed swizzling, negation, constant multiplication 
  on vector components.
  (similar to what Sh does with Attribs)
