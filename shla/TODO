- remove OpenGL dependence
  -change drawQuad to use ShVertexArray 
  -remove glClear
- handle vec ops with different element types
  (e.g. multiply vectors with ShAttrib1f and ShColor3f elements) 
X clean up sharing render temporaries 
  (framebuf, 2D textures, ubufs)
- sparse matrices (use vert arrays for scatter)
X scalar multiplication
- delayed swizzling, negation, constant multiplication 
  on vector components.
  (similar to what Sh does with Attribs)
- fix assignment bug
  (either always make a copy of ubuf, or allow reuse of ubufs and
  do a clone before setData when there is more than one pointer to the ubuf)
