SMALL TASKS:
 X have updating semantics for uniforms
 - have functions to switch the current backend, clearing bound shaders etc. appropriately.
 X need a map of shader kind -> currently bound shader
 X hack constant loading for now by recompiling shader everytime it is bound
 X hack constant loading for now by recompiling shader everytime a uniform is changed.
 - have a setValues() call in ShVariableNode taking an array of indices and an array of values.
 X check into CVS
 - improve error handling in ShParser.cpp
 - add line numbers/filenames to tokens, use this in error handling
 - add additional layer for eror handling: don't throw exceptions by
   default, instead just output to stderr or so.
 - break and continue (requires some extra information)
 X gather variables in ShShader
 X simple SM register allocation
 X add negation to variables
 X compute uniform constant operations in the host
 X send uniform values to SM in the SM backend
 X add Swizzling operators to ShVariable
 - make ShVariable operators return ShVariableN
 - add Swizzling operators to ShVariableN
 X negation in SM backend code upload
 X store ShBackendCode objects in ShShader
 - replace assert() with exceptions/error function

MEDIUM TASKS:
 - port more of the ShLib calls to the new model.
 X code generator
 - add smarter configuration mechanism
 - add "context" concept
 - vectors
 - points
 - colours

LARGE TASKS:
 X finish the parser
 - begin the optimizer
 - matrices
 - textures
 - more backends
