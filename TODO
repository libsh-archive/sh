RELEASE:
 - rename ShShader to ShProgram
 - add SH_BEGIN_{VERTEX, FRAGMENT}_SHADER macros


MATRICES:
 X operator()() extracts submatrix
 X operator[] extracts single row
 X operator{+,-,*,/}=
 X add matrix mults
 - adjunct
 - determinant
 - inverse
 - name()
 - add some matrix expand() call to expand to an ident matrix with top-left submatrix replaced with M
 - identity fetcher

TEXTURES:
 X bind texture units in shader
 - RESOLVE THIS: allocating texture units... how not to conflict between two shaders? Need to talk to Kevin
 X scale lookups in SM backend
 X load data into textures
 - turn 3-textures into 4-textures automatically... in sm backend!
 - update notification
 - mip mapping
 - other lookup mechanisms (bilinear etc.)
 - generic traits mechanism
 - cube maps etc.

SMALL TASKS:
 - check for libpng in configure
 X have updating semantics for uniforms
 - have functions to switch the current backend, clearing bound shaders etc. appropriately.
 X need a map of shader kind -> currently bound shader
 X hack constant loading for now by recompiling shader everytime it is bound
 X hack constant loading for now by recompiling shader everytime a uniform is changed.
 - have a setValues() call in ShVariableNode taking an array of indices and an array of values.
 X check into CVS
 - improve error handling in ShParser.cpp
 - add line numbers/filenames to tokens, use this in error handling
 - add additional layer for eror handling: don't throw exceptions by
   default, instead just output to stderr or so.
 - break and continue (requires some extra information)
 X gather variables in ShShader
 X simple SM register allocation
 X add negation to variables
 X compute uniform constant operations in the host
 X send uniform values to SM in the SM backend
 X add Swizzling operators to ShVariable
 - make ShVariable operators return ShVariableN
 X add Swizzling operators to ShVariableN
 X negation in SM backend code upload
 X store ShBackendCode objects in ShShader
 - replace assert() with exceptions/error function
 - add operator*(T) and similar for division to Sh{Lib*,Matrix}.hpp
 X add operator[] to ShAttrib also to do one-element swizzle.
 - use a ShVariableKind instead of an int template parameter in ShAttrib and ShMatrix

MEDIUM TASKS:
 - port more of the ShLib calls to the new model.
 X code generator
 - add smarter configuration mechanism
 - add "context" concept
 X vectors
 - points
 - colours

LARGE TASKS:
 X linear register allocator
 X finish the parser
 - begin the optimizer
 / matrices
 - textures
 X more backends
