INSTALLATION

See the "INSTALL" file for directions.

STATUS

Sh is currently roughly in the "alpha" stage.

This means it works, but there are several things which are by no
means completed.

The backends aren't quite complete yet. Some operations are
missing from the ARB backend, and in partiuclar texturing is rather
poorly done in the SM backend (only 2D 4-component textures will work
at the moment). This is due to SM not supporting anything else at the
time of writing and also because of the texture management system
needing some work, which should happen in the Fall of 2003 at the
latest.

The syntax for branching and loops is there and it will compile to
proper intermediate code, but these features are not currently
implemented in any of the backends, partly because the targets
themselves (e.g. the ARB specs) don't really support these features at
the moment.

The good news is that it works. Undoubtedly there are bugs here and
there; we welcome you to submit bug reports at http://libsh.sf.net/.
