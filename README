INSTALLATION

See the "INSTALL" file for directions.

STATUS 

Sh is currently roughly in the "beta" stage. Most things are
working. For an overview of what's not working (that we know of) see
https://issues.libsh.org/, our issue tracker.

While there are still bugs here and there, it's certainly usable in
real applications. We welcome your feedback, and would love to hear
from you if you're using Sh for something interesting.

You can reach us at libsh-users@lists.libsh.org. See the Sh homepage 
for details on subscribing to the mailing lists.
