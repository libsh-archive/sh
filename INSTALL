REQUIREMENTS

 - g++ > 3.0.0, >= 4.0 is recommended.
 - libpng
 - for the ARB backend, a recent glext.h as well as GL drivers and headers
   You can obtain the latest glext.h from the SGI OpenGL Registry at
   http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/
 - for the ARB or GLSL backends, you need a GPU that supports shaders: at 
   least a GeForce 5200FX or a Radeon 9600

INSTALLING

Quick compile and installation:
  ./configure
  make
  make install
  [optional] make check

./configure --help will present you with possible options to configure.

For a local installation, the following is useful:

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/install/sh

which will install it under the specified directory (absolute path
is required).

OUT-OF-SOURCE BUILDING

The recommended way to build Sh is to create a new empty directory and run
the configure script from there.

For example if sh has been uncompressed in ~/src/sh/:

  cd $HOME/src/
  mkdir sh_debug
  cd sh_debug
  ../sh/configure --prefix=$HOME/install/sh

DEVELOPMENT

If compiling from CVS, first run:
  ./bootstrap
(also run this if you change any Makefile.am or the configure.ac)
You will need recent versions of autoconf, automake, libtool and
libltdl.
Ignore the message about needing to run aclocal.
