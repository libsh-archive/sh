REQUIREMENTS

 - g++ > 3.0.0, 3.2 is recommended.
 - libpng
 - for the ARB backend, a recent glext.h as well as GL drivers and headers
   You can obtain the latest glext.h from the SGI OpenGL Registry at
   http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/
 - for the SM backend, an installed version of SM (use configure --with-sm=DIR
   to specify the installation directory of SM)

Currently Sh has only been tested on GNU/Linux, but we are planning to
suppot more platforms soon.

INSTALLING

Quick compile and installation:
./configure
make
make install
[optional] make check

./configure --help will present you with possible options to configure.

For a local installation, the following is useful:

./configure --prefix=$HOME/install/sh

which will install it under the specified directory (absolute path
is required).

DEVELOPMENT

If compiling from CVS, first run:
$ ./bootstrap
(also run this if you change any Makefile.am or the configure.ac)
You will need recent versions of autoconf, automake, libtool and
libltdl.
Ignore the mesage about needing to run aclocal.
