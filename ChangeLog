	* src/ShEnvironment.hpp (struct ShEnvironment): Added the
	optimizationLevel variable indication the level of
	optimizations. Set this to 1 to turn on optimizations.

	* src/ShSyntax.cpp (shEndShader): Run the optimizer after parsing.

	* src/ShOptimizer.hpp, src/ShOptimizer.cpp: Added (simple) copy
	propagation, "move elimination" and unused temporary removal.

	* src/ShAttrib.hpp (operator+=, operator-=): Added these operators
	for Attrib1's to once again avoid having to wrap constants in
	ShConstant1f()s.

	* src/ShLib.hpp: Added SH_SHLIB_CONST* macros and calls to these
	to allow scalar constants in operations not have to be wrapped in
	ShConstant1f(). This should make using the library _far_ more
	convenient :).

2003-08-08  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShLib.hpp (cond): Allow scalar cond().

	* backends/sm/ShSmBackend.cpp (addBasicBlock): Support scalar COND instructions.

	* backends/arb/ShArb.cpp (genNode): Support scalar COND instructions.

2003-08-07  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* configure.ac, bootstrap, config/*.m4: Split off some useful
	utility functions into their own M4 files, making the configure.ac
	slightly less verbose.

	* doc/Makefile.am: Added proper rules to build the documentation
	and install/upload it as well.
