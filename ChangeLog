	be refcountable.

2004-04-12  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* Once more, a gigantic patch. ShLib has been split up into
	multiple files, and ShInstructions.{c,h}pp have been added,
	providing "intrinsics" for every intermediate language
	operation. All ShLib functions use these intrinsics. Doxygen
	comments have been fixed up in many places. Compile time has been
	improved. Everything is wonderful. Hurrah!

	* src/scripts/ShAttribImpl.hpp.py (Impl.assign): Use ShGeneric's
	implementations of these functions instead of providing our own.
	No longer include ShLib.hpp.

2004-04-08  Jack Wang  <jmwang@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShQuaternionImpl.hpp: Improved code in getMatrix().

2004-04-07  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* Too many to enumerate: Wow. Big change. Several source files are
	now generated by python. In particular, ShAttrib and all the other
	semantic types are generated. See src/scripts/.
	Also, explicitly instantiate ShAttrib, ShVector, etc.
	Also, rename ShVariableN to ShGeneric and explicitly instantiate
	it.
	Also, remove ShConstant and add ShConstAttrib, etc. instead.
	This is one of a few large changes we had planned before the beta
	happens. Note that right now ShAttrib.cpp takes far too long to
	compile, but I'm working on that. Also going to be explicitly
	instantiating the bulk of ShLib soon, and probably generate
	ShLibPoint.hpp etc.

	* util/ShWorley.hpp: Fix comment.

2004-04-07  Jack Wang  <jmwang@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShImage.cpp: Fixed byte ordering bug in loadPng().

2004-04-06  Jack Wang  <jmwang@uwaterloo.ca>

	16 bit png images.

2004-04-05  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShVariable.hpp (operator): Fix a small bug.

	* src/ShVariable.cpp (setValues): Lock the node before we call all
	the setValue functions.

	* src/ShVariableNode.hpp: Added m_locked member function.

	* src/ShVariableNode.cpp (lock): Added this function.
	(unlock): Added this function.

	directly. Hopefully this will improve immediate computation efficiency.

	* src/ShClamping.hpp: Remove now unnecessary dimension-specific trait
	wrappers.

	* src/ShWrap.hpp: Remove now unnecessary dimension-specific trait
	wrappers.

	* src/ShTexture.hpp: Add default constructors. Remove Mike's
	default sizes.

	* src/ShTable.hpp: Add default constructors.

	* src/ShArray.hpp: Add default constructors.

	* src/ShBaseTexture.hpp: Add constructors that don't take a size.

2004-04-05  Jack Wang  <jmwang@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShQuaternion.hpp: Added structured comments.

2004-04-04  Michael McCool  <mmccool@uwaterloo.ca>

        * src/ShTexture.hpp: added default sizes in constructors
	* src/ShWrap.hpp: Hack to add trait wrappers for 1D, 2D, 3D.
	* src/ShClamping.hpp: Ditto.

	Lack of default constructors was making it hard to allocate
	arrays of textures.   Adding default sizes worked, but then
	also had to add default sizes to trait wrappers.   But then,
	needed different trait wrappers for each number of dimensions...
	ARRRGGH!

	I have concluded that although this works, this is NOT how we
	should do this.   I have commited this code for now but I think
	we should do something else, like make the size a template
	argument (with 0 indicating a "resizable" texture, with no
	memory initially allocated).   Then we can rip out the 1D,
	2D, 3D trait wrappers.  To discuss; maybe there is another way.

	Also added some structured comments in MANY places.   Many
	classes did't even show up under doxygen since not even the
	most minimal commenting had been done.   Also added license
	header to many files (although I think I missed some).  Noted
	a few issues here and there with "TODO".   Anyways, doxygen
	now generates much more complete documentation.

2004-04-01  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShVariableNode.hpp: Added size() member function to change
	size of variables. Don't use this if you're not sure what you're doing.

2004-03-25  Bryan Chan <b8chan@uwaterloo.ca>
	* util/ShKernel*:
	Rewrote the generalized vsh.
	Added other kernels into sepearte categories:
	Surface, Light, Postprocessing.

	* src/ShAlgebra.cpp:
	Added some operations on named ShPrograms
	Changed named connect/combine to automatically duplicate
	values to inputs that have matching name/type.
	Added namedAlign function (namedAlign(a, b) automatically swizzles
	position of a's outputs to match inputs of b by matching names)

	  Added codegen for normalize n-tuples for n != 3.

	* util/ShObjMesh*:
	  Removed some of the mesh processing at load time
	  (vertex consolidation, edge matching, 
	   normalization of normals) since they're not
	  needed in most cases.

2004-02-01  Jack Wang  <jmwang@uwaterloo.ca>
	* src/ShQuaternion.?pp:
	Added ShQuaternion class with basically the same interface as the one

2004-01-31  Bryan Chan  <b8chan@uwaterloo.ca>
	* util/ShPerlinImpl.hpp: Fixed discontinuity problems.
	  (TODO Sh should print a warning if a temporary is used before

2004-01-30  Bryan Chan  <b8chan@uwaterloo.ca>
	* util/ShWorley.cpp (EvenOddSort): Made some changes to allow
	  more efficient dead code removal when either distances or gradients

	down to normalize, abs, and everything else.

	* src/ShSpecialType.hpp: SH_SPECIAL_TYPE_PARENT was broken down
	to OPEN, CONSTRUCTORS, NON_CONST_METHODS, CONST_METHODS, MEMBERS,
	and CLOSE to allow more flexibility.	
	
2004-01-26  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShRefCount.hpp (ShRefCountable): Actually, the
	ShRefCountable operator=() should not do anything. Realised this
	on the way home. Hence also removed the warning comment at the
	top, since luckily this will actually be the behaviour if a
	derived class provides a operator=() but does not call ours!

	* test/ref.sht: Added this simple test to fix bugs in reference
	counting.

	* src/ShSyntax.cpp (shEndShader): Set ShEnvironment::shader to a
	null pointer when we're done with it, possibly freeing up memory
	earlier.

	* backends/arb/ShArbStream.cpp (execute): More verbose error
	message when input arity does not match output arity.

	* backends/arb/ShArbTexture.cpp (loadDataTexture): Delete the
	new'd array that ShMemoryObject gave to us from the data()
	call. ShMemoryObject will be replaced soon, don't worry...

	* src/ShMemoryObject.cpp (ShDataMemoryObject): How about we
	actually delete the data that we allocate with new? Eh, Bryan?

	* src/ShRefCount.hpp (class ShRefCountable): Have fun recompiling!
	Add an operator=() and copy constructor to ShRefCountable, which
	set the refcount to zero, as it should be. Also added a warning at
	the top to those wishing to implement their own operator=() to
	derived classes.
	Added lots of optional debugging output. This helped me find the
	previous bug.

	* src/ShOptimizer.cpp (buildUdDuChains): Clear ud/du chains before
	we build them, in case there is some cruft in there.

2004-01-26  Bryan Chan  <b8chan@uwaterloo.ca>
	* src/ShNibbles.hpp, src/ShNibblesImpl.hpp: 
	Added some useful nibbles.

	* src/ShAttrib.hpp, src/ShSpecialType.hpp:
	Added typedefs for InputType, OutputType, and TempType for Attribs
	and special types
	
2004-01-21  Bryan Chan  <b8chan@uwaterloo.
	* src/ShRefCount.hpp: fixed count in operator=
	(was releasing ref before acquiring ref, so if the old object
	had the only pointer to the new object, the new object would be
	deleted before assignment)

	* src/ShOptimizer.cpp: small fixes to the Input/Output convertor
2004-01-21  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShAttrib.hpp, src/ShVariable.hpp, ...: Change ShFoo1f to
	actually be a float type, instead of a double.

	* backends/arb/ShArbStream.cpp (execute): Arb stream execution
	works now! At least on nvidia... Hooray! Aka the "Stefanus is
	allowed to sleep again" change. This was a lot more work than this
	puny little ChangeLog entry might suggest.

	* backends/arb/ShArbTexture.cpp, backends/arbShArbReg.cpp: Split
	these out of ShArb.cpp to make it a little more manageable.

	* backends/arb/ShArb.hpp: Added some classes from ShArb.cpp to
	facilitate splitting ShArb.cpp into more manageable chunks.

2004-01-19  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* backends/arb/ShArbStream.cpp (execute): Generates fragment
	programs now. All that's left to do is wrestling with pbuffers to
	actually get the "geometry" rendered and read back. Hooray.

	* backends/arb/ShArb.cpp (printSamplingInstruction): Don't output
	a newline.
	(print): When using printSamplingInstruction, use our own line
	numberer to end the line. This will actually add line numbers to
	TEX instructions being output.

	* src/sh.hpp: Added ShChannelNode.hpp, ShChannel.hpp to the list
	of included files.

	* src/ShMemoryObject.cpp (ShDataMemoryObject::setPartialData):

2004-01-14  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShAlgebra.cpp (copyCtrlGraph): Clear head before we do a dfs
	on it. Also, change the /new/ nodes instead of the old ones in the
	successor-changing loop. Furthermore, it would be a good idea to

	(CopyPropagator): Assign negations properly in copy propagation.

	* src/ShAlgebra.cpp (copyCtrlGraph): Added a clearMarked() call
	before we do a DFS on the graph node that's to be copied. This

	in generateCode().

	* src/ShAlgebra.cpp (connect, combine): Allow generic programs and
	determine the resulting program kind appropriately.

	* src/ShAlgebra.hpp: Use generic programs in lose and keep.

	* src/ShSyntax.cpp (shCompileShader): Add bodies for
	shCompileShader.

	* src/ShSyntax.hpp (SH_VERTEX_PROGRAM, SH_FRAGMENT_PROGRAM):
	Rename to these instead of SH_{VERTEX,FRAGMENT}_SHADER.
	(SH_BEGIN_VERTEX_PROGRAM, SH_BEGIN_FRAGMENT_PROGRAM): Add these.
	(SH_BEGIN_PROGRAM): Allow generic programs (without kinds).

2003-08-27  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShAlgebra.hpp: Added operator<<, operator+, lose and keep.

	* src/ShAlgebra.cpp: Added operator<< and operator+ for programs.

	* src/ShOptimizer.hpp, src/ShOptimizer.cpp: Added straightening.
	Loop over optimizations until a fixed point is reached.

	* src/ShCtrlGraph.hpp: Added constructor taking a tail and a head,
	for the ShAlgebra operations.

	* src/sh.hpp: Added ShAlgebra.hpp to included files.

	* src/ShAlgebra.cpp, src/ShAlgebra.hpp: Added combine and connect
	functions.

2003-08-26  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShBitSet.hpp, src/ShBitSet.cpp: Added operator== and operator!=.

	* src/ShLib.hpp (kill): Pass in the extra argument to SH_OP_KIL.

	* src/ShStatement.cpp: Make KIL take one (ignored) argument. This
	is useful for the optimzer. Added OPTBRA instruction info.

	* src/ShStatement.hpp: Data structures for ud/du chains, added
	OPTBRA instruction for the optimizer. Use src[3] instead of src1,
	src2, src3 in ShStatement.

	* src/ShOptimizer.cpp, src/ShOptimizer.hpp: Added du/ud-chain
	construction and dead code elimination. Lots and lots of code.

2003-08-25  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/Makefile.am (CXXFLAGS): Enable optimizations.

	* src/ShStatement.hpp: Add an XPD statement.

	* src/ShVariableNode.cpp (ShVariableNode): Initialize variables
	with 0 in each element.

	* src/ShMatrixImpl.hpp (ShMatrix): Initialize matrices with
	identity matrices.

	* src/ShLib.hpp (cross): Add a cross product routine for 3-tuples.

2003-08-22  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShOptimizer.cpp (copyValue): Improve efficiency slightly.

	* test/bitset.cpp: Added simple bitset test.

	* src/ShBitSet.cpp, src/ShBitSet.hpp: Added ShBitSet class for the
	optimizer.

2003-08-20  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShStatement.cpp (operator<<): Print negations.

	* src/ShBasicBlock.hpp (ShBasicBlock::erase): Return the result of
	the erase operation (i.e. the iterator one past the erased element).

	* src/ShOptimizer.cpp: Improved the iterate-erase loops used in
	the optimizations.

2003-08-19  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShOptimizer.cpp (struct TempFinder): Mark temporaries used
	in branches as necessary.

	* src/ShEnvironment.hpp (struct ShEnvironment): Added the
	optimizationLevel variable indication the level of
	optimizations. Set this to 1 to turn on optimizations.

	* src/ShSyntax.cpp (shEndShader): Run the optimizer after parsing.

	* src/ShOptimizer.hpp, src/ShOptimizer.cpp: Added (simple) copy
	propagation, "move elimination" and unused temporary removal.

2003-08-11  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShAttrib.hpp (operator+=, operator-=): Added these operators
	for Attrib1's to once again avoid having to wrap constants in
	ShConstant1f()s.

	* src/ShLib.hpp: Added SH_SHLIB_CONST* macros and calls to these
	to allow scalar constants in operations not have to be wrapped in
	ShConstant1f(). This should make using the library _far_ more
	convenient :).

2003-08-08  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* src/ShLib.hpp (cond): Allow scalar cond().

	* backends/sm/ShSmBackend.cpp (addBasicBlock): Support scalar COND instructions.

	* backends/arb/ShArb.cpp (genNode): Support scalar COND instructions.

2003-08-07  Stefanus Du Toit  <sjdutoit@uwaterloo.ca>

	* configure.ac, bootstrap, config/*.m4: Split off some useful
	utility functions into their own M4 files, making the configure.ac
	slightly less verbose.

	* doc/Makefile.am: Added proper rules to build the documentation
	and install/upload it as well.
