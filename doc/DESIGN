Some less obvious design decisions are listed here.

=== Matrices ===

Obviously, it would be nice if a swizzled submatrix obtained from
another matrix shared the data and then did copy-on-write for
efficiency.

On the other hand, doing the copy directly simplifies the code
drastically. We can rely on the optimizer to in fact propagate values
in such a way that we get the same (possibly more fine-grained even!)
effect as we would with a COW optimisation but in a much more
self-contained way.

Another issue is that of operator[] vs operator(). Since operator() is
used to swizzle attributes it would seem obvious to also use it to
swizzle matrices (obtaining a proper submatrix every two swizzles). In
many situations however one will want to obtain a particular row as an
actual attribute, rather than a matrix itself. Thus it seemed sensible
to make this the job of operator[], to extract exactly one row (since
it can only take one parameter anyways).
