Additional OSX Notes
====================

The OSX version of Sh has been tested on limited platforms.  It works
on OSX v10.3.5.  It may work in previous versions. TODO: check opengl
versions on diferent OS's

If you have checked out Sh from Subversion, you will need to have
fink installed with the following packages:
  automake1.7 or newer  (Panther comes with 1.6.3 and Sh needs >=1.7)
  libtool14

To compile Sh, regardless of whether you got it from Subversion or a
release, you will need the following fink packages:
  libpng3

Configure Sh just as you would for any other backend, i.e.
  ./configure [any additional options]

The cc and ARB backends are known to work.

Floating point textures should work, but are untested. PBufferStreams
(i.e. stream programs in the ARB backend) have not been implemented on
OSX yet.

Maintainer Notes
================

this may break the main build:
i had to comment out -no-undefined libtool option in util/Makefile.am.  There were undefined extrernals.  Perhaps autoconf was unable to include the sh dynamic library in this step for some reason?  Is this flag needed for linux?

Perhaps there is a way to merge the boostrap switch statement

I needed to modify ShLibClampImpl.hpp to build recent shrike checkins because of the explicit instantiation of 
  template<int N, typename T>
  ShGeneric<1, T> max(const ShGeneric<N, T>& a)
was creating a zero-length array.  Were you having this problem on other platforms?

make shmedia fails
    Darwin's cp doesn't support -a option
    a quick web search suggests that -pPR does the same thing and is supported in linux
