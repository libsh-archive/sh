This directory contains a very minimal example of using Sh in a glut-based
application. This may be useful for you to use as a basis for building your own
Sh-enabled programs.

You will need to change the installation location in the Makefile if you are
compiling under Linux, or change some of the variables in Makefile.win32 if
compiling under Windows.

Note that this example also appears in the Sh book.

Enjoy,

Stefanus
