- when changing resolution of a FBO texture, have to change viewport

- solved the problem of not seeing particles with 32bit buffers - force z=0 in shader

- using Rect textures results in some weird behaviour: after 10 frames, positions jump back to their initial positions. 

- 16bit precision for velocity/density texture results in drift of positions (32bit).
Using 32bit precision for v/d tex eliminates the drift, but the lack of interpolation causes particles to vibrate and oscillate. 
   Perhaps best solution is to do fuul 3d 32bit interpolation in a shader
