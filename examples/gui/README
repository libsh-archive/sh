uish notes

Wanted OpenGL based widget library that could support
  -unusual layouts of widgets
    -graph layouts
    -(sort of) arbitrary transformations btw parent and widget
  -support for mixing 3D elements in 2D widgets (eg. for previews, or error viz
  -customizable widget styles (user-specified opengl rendering code)
    -shader support on widgets (same problems though as how to integrate shaders
    into scene graphs)
    (most of the existing widget kits look like crap)

Available options glgooey, GLUI, GLOW not flexible enough (or not documented 
enough to modify) 

@todo
  -event processing sucks
    -mouse press, motion issues
    (may want to use picking?)
    -make sure invariants for the events satisfied
  -modularity sucks
    -refine uishBase
    -make sure only functions that should be virtual are virtual

  -containers
    -box should expose internal dimensions (without border)
  -convert functions to use Sh types (e.g. width/heights, bounding boxes, etc.)

  -should have begin_render, end_render so that things in borders don't have to
  deal with border width themselves


Widgets

Container Widgets
  uishBase        - OpenGL root widget (can only hold one child widget, which is
                    resized to fill the whole opengl canvas)
  uishFrame       - OpenGL frame that holds one child and resizes to fit child's size
  uishFixedFrame  - OpenGL frame that scales one child to fit its size
  uishGraphLayout - graph layout of fixed size children with edges between them 
  uishPackLayout  - pack layout that may stretch children to meet requested size
                    and expand to fit children

uishLabel     - text label
uishBox       - box with border
