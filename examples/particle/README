This directory contains a very minimal example of using streams with Sh. This
may be useful for you to use as a basis for building your own stream programs.

You will need to change the installation location in the Makefile if you are
compiling under Linux, or change some of the variables in Makefile.win32 if
compiling under Windows.

Note that this example also appears in the Sh book.

Enjoy,

Kevin
