 - make sure all "release-critical" bugs are fixed
 
 - edit configure.ac and change the version at the top
 - make a new svn branch for the release:
     svn cp https://svn.libsh.org/sh/{trunk,tags/0.7.9}

 - check out that branch in a separate directory
 - ./bootstrap
 - ./configure (with usual arguments)
 - make dist
 - untar the newly created .tar.gz somewhere
 - cd there
 - ./configure (with previously unused prefix to install in)
    (e.g. $HOME/sh-dist-$DATE)
 - make
 - make install
 - make checkall
 - test each program under examples/

 - commit and merge the changes back to the trunk (if any)
 
 - repeat similar steps for shrike and shmedia
 
 - copy using anonymous FTP to upload.sourceforge.net in the incoming directory
 - add to file tracker (remember the ChangeLog entries, etc.)
 
 - make upload-docs (must "apt-get install doxygen graphviz" first)

 - copy source file to dali:/home/torrent/pub
 - create a torrent for it:
     btmakemetafile shmedia-0.7.9.tar.gz http://69.159.216.164:25409/announce
 - copy the torrent to /var/www/libsh.org/torrents/
 - modify the /home/torrent/bin/start_seeders script

 - modify the download page (dali:/var/www/libsh.org/download.tphp) to update the version number
 
 - add news to homepage (dali.serioushack.com:/var/www/libsh.org/index.thtml)
 - e-mail the release notes (+ download link) to the mailing list
 - add a note on Sourceforge for the RSS feed
