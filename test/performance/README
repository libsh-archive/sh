Very rough first attempt at some performance tests.  This certainly does not cover all Sh functionality, but it was a simple test to make sure
the storage type branch was not significantly slower on basic computation. 

Test descriptions
    compile         5000 compiles to cc backend with optimizations
    mat_asn_scal    100000 asn matrix elements as scalars (from libsh-devel list)
    mat_asn_vec     100000 asn matrix rows as vectors (from libsh-devel list)
    mat_mul         30000 4x4 matrix-matrix multiplication
    vec3_add        1000000 vec adds, not swizzled 
    vec3_add_swiz   1000000 vec adds, all operands swizzed

Running all tests:
    make all
    ./runall

Running a specific test for a given number of runs:
    ./runtest vec3_add 5

Use ./sum to get a summary


Profiling SH
------------

To run any of the tests through gprof (generates a <test>.prof file):
  make <testname>.prof
